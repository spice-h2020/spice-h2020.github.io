Dear **SPICEr**

January always starts off with **good intentions**, but we are here to give you a little push so that these good intentions continue throughout the year. That's why, in this newsletter, we want to bring you a small sample of this purpose of **bringing culture to everyone**.

<!--end_excerpt-->

In recent years new forms of citizen participation in cultural heritage have emerged, producing a wealth of material relevant to curatorial practices, spanning from visitors' experiential feedback to exhibitions and cultural artefacts, to digitally mediated forms of interaction. However, there are open questions on how digital innovation can influence and support new ways of engaging with cultural heritage.

Here are some examples, within our **SPICE** project ðŸ˜Š:

## MUSEUMS FROM A NEW PERSPECTIVE

**Children at the museum**

Last November, two groups of 5th grade students from CEIP Bachiller Alonso LÃ³pez in Alcobendas, a city near Madrid, participated in an activity organized by SPICE researchers at the [@museocienciasmadrid](https://www.instagram.com/museocienciasmadrid/). The overall engagement consisted of three individual activities:

A few days before the visit to the museum, at the school they explained to the children the concept of **biodiversity**, its relationship to evolution and the factors that are currently causing biodiversity loss.
At the **museum**, the schoolchildren took part in a **treasure hunt** game where the search and problem-solving phases were interspersed with explanations from the museum educator about biodiversity, evolution and biodiversity loss. After the treasure hunt, the educator talked about two species, one a conservation success story and the other a failure.
Finally, back at school, the teachers gave the children a third activity: they had to choose the lynx or the Thylacine, **write their story and draw it**.

This case study demonstrates the successful application of technology and play as a means of engaging young people's interest in natural science and biodiversity.

The **27th Annual Conference for Digital Research in the Humanities and Arts** (DRHA 2023) will bring together artists, scholars, educators, curators, digital researchers, and entrepreneurs interested in the ways digital technologies intersect with the arts and humanities. The 2023 conference celebrates the interplay between notions of intangible and tangible heritage, investigating how digital strategies can be used to widen participation, facilitate inclusivity, and promote a wider range of ways of appreciating and understanding the intersections between our tangible and intangible heritage.
