In SPICE we are endeavouring to create **new tools and methods which help European citizens to interpret culture** and tell their own stories.

With these objectives in mind on October 29th 2020 SPICE Work Package 7 organized a [mini-conference](https://spice-h2020.eu/2020/10/29/spiceminiconference.html) **with the aim of specifying the situation of the five case studies**  that are going to be carried out in SPICE ([Irish Museum of Modern Art](https://imma.ie/), [Design Museum Helsinki](https://www.designmuseum.fi/en/), [Fondazione Torino Musei (GAM)](https://www.fondazionetorinomusei.it/it), [Hecht Museum](https://mushecht.haifa.ac.il/index.php?lang=en), [National Museum of Natural Sciences](https://www.mncn.csic.es/en)). There day-long mini-conference consisted of four workshops examining interpretation of cultural heritage as well as co-design methods:

* Citizen interpretation methods using artefact analysis
* Persona development along with users, communities and stakeholders 
* Charting activities in context through UX and service maps 
* User interface design possibilities.

## Experience in UX Map of curation activity

An example of the contributions made by participants during the mini-conference can be found in the user experience map created as part of the curation activity carried out. This map contains points of contact between the museum and its visitors:

**Emotions** : diversity of moods that may arise during the journey

**Breakdowns** : obstacles that prevent the journey;

**Solutions**.

The figure below demonstrates visitors&#39; user-journey developed and iterated by the participants:

## Experience in Interface design for the museums

In another workshop about interface design for the museums the objective was to  **agree a set of interface components that would enable an initial prototype**  to be developed within a six-month period. For each interface in turn each participant had to add their ratings individually, then discuss and add any group comments. In this one-hour workshop we brought everyone together to consider [interfaces for a visit](https://padlet.com/esteem/spice_mc1_w4_p1), [interfaces for interpretations](https://padlet.com/esteem/spice_mc1_w4_p2), and [interfaces for reflection and scripting](https://padlet.com/esteem/spice_mc1_w4_p3).

Thanks to the interesting input from the participants in the four workshops the  **main objective ** of the mini-conference was achieved:  **to create and test case studies for an exemplary combination**  of methods that can be implemented in the interpretation-reflection spiral.

With these results,  **SPICE has established a set of evaluation protocols to implement them in the real case studies to be carried out in the** [project](https://spice-h2020.eu/project/) **.**
