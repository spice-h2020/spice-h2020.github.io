Today we want to share with you a very interesting European project, a congress that deals with the theme of museums in the current circumstances and an article. 
We work together for the social cohesion, participation and inclusion through cultural engagement, that is why we present you every month some recommendations that can help us learn about other projects, read about the topics that interest us and know what is happening in the world around culture and citizenship. 
We hope it is of your interest!
