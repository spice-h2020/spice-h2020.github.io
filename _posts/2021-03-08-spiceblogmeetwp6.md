title: Meet SPICE Work Packages&#58; Integrating Systems for Citizen Curation
tag: WP6

Let&#39;s get to know it! Today in &quot;Meet Spice&quot;, following on the objectives and relations of SPICE Work Packages, it is time to know about **SPICE Work Package 6: Integrating Systems**.

<h2> What is WP6&#39;s work based on? </h2>

SPICE WP6 is developing an integrated  **socio-technical system**  for  **citizen curation**  by devising a core technical research infrastructure where  **ontologies and semantic reasoning**  services will be used for the  **description and interpretation of user activities**.

Our goal is to provide both a conceptual and system integration of the different services developed in the project. The  **conceptual integration**  is based on the development of a network of ontologies that will support service interoperability and content enrichment of museum objects via reasoning; the  **system integration**  involves the coordination of the interfacing components from the other technical WPs.

We work in close relation with **[WP4 (&quot;Distributed Linked Data social media layer&quot;)](https://spice-h2020.eu/2020/12/03/spicelinkeddatahub.html)** for what concerns the support of knowledge exchange formats used to trigger reasoning activities and for the definition of  **&quot;scripts&quot;**  (i.e. the socio-technical activities leading citizens towards the processes of interpretation and reflection). Scripts also provide the blueprint for integrating user and community modelling and recommendations with an ontology-based content enrichment.

This is an ambitious project in the context Cultural-AI and requires to resort and to integrate several components.&quot;
