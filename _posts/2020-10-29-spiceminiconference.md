On October 29, we will hold the first of many future conferences and webinars to reflect on Citizen curation methods and develop a set of evaluation protocols to establish in the project's case studies.
This post serves as an introduction to start talking about our activities and we are more than happy to get as many people interested in participating in the event as possible, so share this content on your social networks and join us this Thursday.
Once the mini-conference is over, a post with the main conclusions will be shared through our social media.
