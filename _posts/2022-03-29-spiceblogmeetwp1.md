## ONE YEAR OF SPICE: Work Package 1

**Over the last year WP1 has accomplished many important results in the context of many activities. Here below an overview of our accomplishments.**

ðŸ”¸ We selected **methods** for activating the Interpretation-Reflection-Loop (IRL). Methods have been adapted to the SPICE case studies in Finland, Ireland, Spain, Italy and Israel, and partly implemented with prototypes and co-design workshops.

ðŸ”¸ We have developed **prototypes** to configure, detect, visualize, understand, explain, and navigate through citizen communities. The tools are designed to understand citizen social structures, relations between communities, and to help citizens to build representations of themselves within groups (social bonding) and to facilitate understanding and perspective-taking across groups (social bridging).

ðŸ”¸ We have started the design of tools for the **semantic annotation** of curatorial products such as stories and presentations. A semantic multilingual annotator has been implemented for English, Finnish, Hebrew, Italian and Spanish. It annotates sentiment, emotion and public identity of entities. The reference system for annotation comes from the SPICE Ontology Network (SON). 

ðŸ”¸ We designed a **technical ecosystem** for the SPICE project. It stems from our survey of data infrastructures for Cultural Heritage, the requirements for citizen curation activities, and content/data management/copyright practices from the museum members of SPICE. Its implementation has focused on creating a linked data ecosystem that supports the management of data streams from diverse sources, with fine-grained access control. It  consists of a novel universal transformer for arbitrary data (SPARQLAnything), a novel platform for linked data storage (the Linked Data Hub), and a Linked Data Intelligence layer to connect to local applications.

ðŸ”¸ We developed the **SPICE Ontology Network** (SON), including newly designed (or integrated) state-of-the-art ontology modules enabling the description of cultural objects and their sense-making aggregation during IRL activities. Notable novel ontologies represent emotional, narrative and value-based aspects that are at the core of cultural sense-making.

To achieve such results, we have carried out an **extensive analysis of previous citizen curation systems**, in order to identify the most appropriate interaction paradigms for SPICE, and the necessary interfaces for citizen curation. We also **organised several events**, including two mini-conferences and ethnographic interviews, to co-design methods for inclusive citizen curation and social cohesion. Case studies have been using co-design to bootstrap engagement with mediators and end-user communities prior to conducting workshops with them.

## Work Package 1 in 2022

![]({{ site.url }}assets/img/team/map.png){:.peoplePostImageInline} This year will be devoted to the implementation and validation of methods and techniques so that (1) museums will be able to manage their digital resources and **understand how citizens respond to their collections**, and (2) citizens will be provided with data-centric, AI-informed technologies and methods that support them in **interpreting culture for themselves**.
