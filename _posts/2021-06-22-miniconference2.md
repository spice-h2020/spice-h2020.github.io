On March 23, the **second [SPICE](https://spice-h2020.eu/) mini-conference**  took place in which methodologies would be established  **to connect culture with citizens.**  The all-day session was conducted by **Work Package 2 (Citizen curation methods)** and **Work Package 5 (Interface design)** as well as co-designed by **Work Package 7 (Codesign and evaluation of citizen curation activities)**.

Innovative methodologies such as artifact analysis, visualization techniques, collecting and narrative methods, cultural semiotics and duoethnography were discussed during the mini-conference, In the same way, the advances of the different case studies were presented with the aim os exploring how to best combine interpretation and reflection methods, related activities and mock-ups in a &#39;user-journey loop&#39;. The interpretation-reflection loop illustrates the iterative process in SPICE for generating unique citizen curation activities by combining interpretation and reflection methods.

With this objective in mind, two main activities were developed during the mini conference eventually assisted WP7 in  **monitoring the development and progress of the case studies and situating these in the updated sociotechnical roadmap**.

- Through the selection of particular methods,  **Work Package 2**  sought to explore how the case studies would make use of citizens&#39; produced interpretations of cultural objects as well as narratives and reflections on these contributions.

- **Work Package 5 coordinated with WP2**  to understand how the case studies would elaborate on the aspects of the citizen curation activities conducted with their end-user communities based on the &quot;mock-up scenario&quot; interfaces created for museum professionals.

Finally pre-requisites were provided to all the case studies ([Design Museum Helsinki](https://www.designmuseum.fi/en/), [Hecht Museum](https://www.haifa.ac.il/index.php/en/), [Fondazione Torino Musei](https://www.fondazionetorinomusei.it/it), [Irish Museum of Modern Art](https://imma.ie/), [Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales](https://www.mncn.csic.es/en)) to create their own mock-up scenarios and present them at the event.

The Mini-conference was also complemented by presentations provided by some of the key partners as well as a workshop wherein members of the case studies worked together to develop the interpretation and reflection methods to be used by their own museums.
