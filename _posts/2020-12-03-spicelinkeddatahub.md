It&#39;s time to know the objectives and relations of [SPICE Work Packages](https://spice-h2020.eu/project/) and this time is for SPICE Work Package 4. SPICE **WP4 is developing the Linked Data infrastructure** to connect cultural objects, collections, and citizen contributions.

Being the backbone for interoperability and knowledge exchange within the project, WP4 aims at providing a data exchange layer and researching and developing a novel type of social media platform that can **support museums in sharing their digital collections**. In addition, such a platform will support developers of applications for citizen engagement in requesting and negotiating access to digital resources and exploiting a stack of intelligent services for content discovery, analysis, and tracing.

We aim at building a development infrastructure to allow citizens&#39; opinions, responses, and memories to be shared within safe channels preserving the privacy, ownership, and fair use of the resources involved.

WP4 is currently developing the **SPICE Linked Data Hub** , the central entry point to the SPICE Linked Data Network. At the same time, the WP4 team is actively engaging with museum partners and collecting requirements for managing copyrights and usage policies, and for linking digital collections of the museums within the SPICE data network. WP4 works in close relation with WP6 (Integrating Systems for Citizen Curation) for what concerns knowledge representation and reasoning aspects and for supporting the task of scripting citizen curation.

&quot;Museums struggle at reaching their audience through mass social media, as this implies sharing content that is often protected by copyright into across platforms where the control over the assets is easily lost. Besides, they need support in collecting visitor responses into their digital archives in a way that is meaningful but protecting citizen&#39;s privacy. Our vision is to equip memory institutions and their stakeholders with a digital space that is at the same time communal, ubiquitous, and safe.&quot;
