Dear **SPICEr**

We have welcomed Fall üçÇ with an array of very interesting updates we are sure you are going to love. For example, a **new museum definition** aligned very closely with the objectives in the SPICE Project: developing of tools and methods of citizen curation that support accessibility, inclusivity, diversity, and community participation.
<!--end_excerpt-->

This is also the objective behind the upcoming **BRANCACCI POV** prototype, an interesting project you will want to learn more about for sure.

And these are just two of the many other updates we would like to share with you üòä.

After years of debate and consultation, ICOM has a [new museum definition](https://icom.museum/en/resources/standards-guidelines/museum-definition/), which was voted on in the last General Assembly in Prague.

‚Äú*A museum is a not-for-profit, permanent institution in the service of society that researches, collects, conserves, interprets and exhibits tangible and intangible heritage. Open to the public, accessible and inclusive, museums foster diversity and sustainability. They operate and communicate ethically, professionally and with the participation of communities, offering varied experiences for education, enjoyment, reflection, and knowledge sharing.*‚Äù

## NEW IN THE NEWS

[![]({{ site.url }}assets/img/team/curate.png){:class="img-fluid"}{:.peoplePostImageInline}](https://twitter.com/SpiceH2020/status/1527226745484623872?s=20&t=tBaHd0LEaDRAf0vm9mfuwg)**New perspectives on museum collections**

Discover two recent exhibitions curated by groups of 'non-professionals' to share new perspectives on museum collections:

**'Guarding the Art'**, in which security guards at the Baltimore Museum of Art have selected pieces from the collection, including some that have been exhibited before.

**'Shining Mystery'** at Zentrum Paul Klee in Bern. Here, children have taken on the lead role as curators.

The creation of an international master's degree (DHDK), a PhD (CHeDE) and a research center (/DH.arc) are the results of refining the notion of Digital Humanities in a new **bidirectional way**: to reflect on computational methodologies and models in the cultural sphere and to suggest a cultural approach to Informatics.

Interesting, right?
