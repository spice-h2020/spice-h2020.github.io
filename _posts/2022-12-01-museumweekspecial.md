## PAPER

![]({{ site.url }}assets/img/team/paper.png){:class="img-fluid"}{:.peoplePostImageInline}**Language-based approaches to emotion categorization**

â€œ*A complementary account to emotion extraction and classification in #culturalheritage based on the Plutchikâ€™s theory*" by Andrea Bolioli, Alessio Bosca, Rossana Damiano, Antonio Lieto and Manuel Striani. This paper presents a combined approach to knowledge-based emotion attribution and classification of cultural items employed in the H2020 project SPICE. In particular, we show a preliminary experimentation conducted on a selection of items contributed by the [GAM Museum](https://www.gamtorino.it/it) in Turin (Galleria di Arte Moderna).

## NEWS

![]({{ site.url }}assets/img/team/slowlooking.png){:class="img-fluid"}{:.peoplePostImageInline}**The value of slow looking**

As part of a recent collaboration, members of the **Royal College of Physicians** of Ireland immersed themselves in art and experienced a world completely removed from work. Doctors explored the IMMA Collection through the eyes of chronically ill teenagers from [@HeliumArts](https://twitter.com/heliumarts) Youth Advisory Group, who curated their own response to the Queer Embodiment exhibition, with a SPICE Citizen Curation script titled **'Uncomfortably Beautiful'**, which shared their perspectives on works by Alice Maher and other artists.
