        "title" : "Participatory Citizen Curation in the VAST Project Framework",
        "description": "In this paper, we present a participatory approach to citizen curation developed in the framework of the EU H2020 VAST (Values Across Space and Time) project. VAST focuses on the transformation of values across space and time, with particular emphasis on the core European Values, that is human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, rule of law and human rights. The VAST project studies how values are communicated and perceived today, by collecting, digitising, and analysing narratives and experiences of both value communicators, such as artists, museum curators, educators, and their respective audiences, like spectators, museum visitors, and students. In the paper, we will present the structure of the VAST knowledge graph that has been conceived to represent different and potentially conflicting interpretations provided by users, either expert or non-expert ones, about values. In particular, we promote two different modalities for feeding the graph called design-by-collaboration and design-by-engagement.",
