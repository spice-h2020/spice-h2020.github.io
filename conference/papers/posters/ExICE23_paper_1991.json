        "title" : "Storifying Data for Museum Audiences",
        "description": "Recent years have witnessed an increased development and adoption of digital technologies in the cultural heritage sector. Besides helping promote wider accessibility and participation, it has also enabled museums and heritage institutions to gain access to cultural heritage data and unique insights on visitors’ experiences with cultural heritage. However, while these resources hold the potential in helping facilitate the sharing of knowledge, and support engaging diverse perspectives, there still exists limited research on methods and tools that could aid museum professionals and educators in effectively communicating derived insights to their audiences. By recognizing narratives as a basic mode of communication and sensemaking, this paper explores methods and approaches for designing data-based narratives in the cultural heritage domain. Building on the practice of data narration, the notions of narrative identity and the semiosphere, we suggest a framework for building data stories that can eventually be implemented and used by museum staff with their audiences. The framework is illustrated in the context of the EU Horizon 2020 project SPICE (Social Cohesion, Participation, Inclusion through Cultural Engagement) and the findings will be discussed in relation to citizen engagement for social cohesion initiatives in the cultural heritage domain.",
