        "title" : "Co-design of treasure hunts for a Natural History Museum",
        "description": "This paper describes 3 iterations of co-design of educational treasure hunts for a natural history museum in Spain. Game designers have collaborated with primary and secondary school teachers, and mu- seum educators to find good solutions to the problems we faced in the design of a visit to the museum that serves to draw children’s attention to the problems of biodiversity loss, and to understand the impact that our consumption habits have on nature.",
